This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get your application up and running.

### What is this repository for? ###

* Updated version of Dorad Smartphone app. Built in .Net Maui with SQLite database.
* Version 1.0

### How do I get set up? ###

* Summary of set up
* Configuration - Must open Visual Studio Installer, go in Modify, search for Desktop & Mobile and check the .Net Multi-platform App UI Development option. This will allow to visual studio download all necessary libraries and emulators.
* Dependencies - NuGet should handle all, but in case something goes wrong search for this:
	- CommunityToolkit.Mvvm 8.2.0	
	- SQLiteNetExtensions 2.1.0
	- sqlite-net-pc 1.8.116
	- SkiaSharp 2.88.3
	- AutoMapper 12.0.1
	- Microcharts.Maui 1.0.0
	
* Database configuration - Since we don't use any big database, none.
* How to run tests - Download any android emulator and try it out! Bluetooth does not work in emulators and some other features like maps are unstable in emulators.
* Deployment instructions - Emulators: look for Open Android Device Manager icon, choose a version, download it and hit the play. Physical device: should have ADB enabled for it.
